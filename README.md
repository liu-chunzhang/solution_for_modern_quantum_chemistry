本仓库整理了Attila Szabo和Neil S. Outlund于1982年所著《Modern Quantum Chemistry》第1章至第6章的所有习题及其详细解答。我坚信这是目前所能找到的最详细的解答。

This repository compiles and organizes all the exercises and detailed solutions from chapters 1 to 6 of "Modern Quantum Chemistry" by Attila Szabo and Neil S. Ostlund, published in 1982. I am confident that this is the most comprehensive set of solutions available.

这份答案的纸质版早在我博士一年级时就已经写好并扫描为PDF文件上传到GitHub了，你仍可以在本仓库的original_pdf_files文件夹内找到。不过，事后整理发现其中仍有不少错误，不删除它仅仅是为了纪念过去，因此我不建议读者将其作为参考。

The paper version was completed during my first year as a PhD student and was scanned and uploaded as PDF files to GitHub. You can still find them in the original_pdf_files folder in this repository. However, upon review, I found numerous errors. I have kept them for posterity but strongly advise against using them as a reference.

时光荏苒，不经意间我已经博士四年级了。我想，如果现在不整理这份手稿，以后可能更没有时间整理。于是我下定决心，牺牲了整个春节假期将其彻底整理完成。这不仅是为了记录自己学习的过去，加深对这些经典内容的理解，也希望后来的读者能够更有条理地学习相关内容。

Time flies, and now I am in my fourth year of PhD studies. I realized that if I did not organize this manuscript now, I might never have the time to do so. Thus, I dedicated my entire Spring Festival holiday to thoroughly revise and complete this task. This effort is not only to document my past learning and deepen my understanding of these classic topics, but also to help future readers of this book express the relevant content more clearly.

尽管我已经非常仔细地检查过了，但不能保证没有笔误。如果你发现任何问题，请通过shuangchengxue@gmail.com联系我，让我们一起讨论。

Although I have meticulously checked everything, I cannot guarantee that there are no errors. If you find any issues, please feel free to contact me at shuangchengxue@gmail.com for discussion.
