	\begin{equation*}
		(\omega\I-\A){\bf x} = {\bf c}
	\end{equation*}
	for ${\bf x}$. The most straightforward way to proceed is to invert $\omega \I - \A$, i.e., 
	\begin{equation*}
		{\bf x} = (\omega \I - \A)^{-1} {\bf c} = {\bf G}(\omega) {\bf c}
	\end{equation*}
	If we want ${\bf x}$ as a function of $\omega$ we need to invert the matrix for {\it each} value of $\omega$. However, if we diagonalize $\A$, we can write
	\begin{equation*}
		x_i = \sum_j ({\bf G}(\omega))_{ij}c_j = \sum_{j\alpha} \frac{ U_{i\alpha}U^*_{j\alpha} c_j}{\omega-a_\alpha}.
	\end{equation*}
